        <h2>Assalamualaikum Warahmatullah</h2>
        <p>every new club must have at least one member and no
            two clubs will have the exact same set of members. The second rule, however, was delightfully
            peculiar. It decreed that any new club must share at least one member with every existing club.
            In Evertown, isolation was unheard of; connections wove through the community like threads in
            a tapestry.
            For the past week, Mr. Every had been consumed by a perplexing
            riddle. He pondered endlessly: what was the maximum number of
            clubs that could flourish in Evertown while honoring the town's whimsical rules? The question
            danced in his mind like golden snitches on a Quidditch field. Could someone perhaps aid Mr.
            Every in unraveling this enigma by determining the precise number, k, and providing irrefutable
            proof that k clubs can indeed exist, but not a single one more?</p>
