        <h2>Assalamualaikum Warahmatullah</h2>
        <p>Hidden away from the prying eyes of the mundane world, Evertown was a most curious place
            indeed. Nestled between rolling hills and ancient forests, it was home to exactly thirteen
            inhabitants—no more, no less. The townsfolk had an uncanny fondness for forming clubs,
            gatherings where tales were spun and secrets whispered under the glow of candlelight. Yet, just
            as much as they loved their clubs, they adored crafting intricate rules to govern them.
            One such rule was quite straightforward: every new club must have at least one member and no
            two clubs will have the exact same set of members. The second rule, however, was delightfully
            peculiar. It decreed that any new club must share at least one member with every existing club.
            In Evertown, isolation was unheard of; connections wove through the community like threads in
            a tapestry.
            All new clubs were meticulously recorded by Mr. Every, the diligent
            keeper of records at the town hall. A tall man with twinkling eyes
            behind half-moon spectacles, he harbored a deep love for the art of
            discrete mathematics, despite never having attended a day at any
            wizarding academy—a consequence of Evertown's eccentric
            traditions of course.
            For the past week, Mr. Every had been consumed by a perplexing
            riddle. He pondered endlessly: what was the maximum number of

            clubs that could flourish in Evertown while honoring the town's whimsical rules? The question
            danced in his mind like golden snitches on a Quidditch field. Could someone perhaps aid Mr.
            Every in unraveling this enigma by determining the precise number, k, and providing irrefutable
            proof that k clubs can indeed exist, but not a single one more?</p>
